## The Mission

Create a webpage where you can check the exchange rate.

#### Must-have features

- Pick your next travel destination and check the exchange rate: local currency / Euros.
- Make a small webpage where you can enter the local rate (use a form) and it'll tell you the price in Euros.
- Use a form that submits to PHP (no JS allowed / no preventDefault)

#### Nice-to-have features

- Allow the user to choose between different currencies
- Provide a button to switch the from / to valuta types (So Euro -> Dollar becomes Dollar --> Euro)
